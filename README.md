# Speeding-up-motif-finding-KMP-Algo

 Position Weight Matrices are broadly used probabilistic motif models. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying and characterizing potential overlaps between occurrences of such a motif. It has useful applications to the statistics of the number of occurrences, and to weighted pattern matching with an extension of the well-known Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
